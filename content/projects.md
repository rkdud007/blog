I enjoy building in public - cus sharing ideas and code is playing a positive-sum game ≽^-⩊-^≼

- When I encounter new technology or an interesting concept, I often think about its potential applications, consider how it could be combined with other ideas, and i build experimental projects around and share publicly.
- I like to create and contribute to open-source projects, cli or library that I find useful and share them so others can benefit.

Here are some of my projects, sometimes im a bit lazy about updating this list. For more, [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007) for the latest!

⭐️ **Highlighted Projects**

- [**xxfunc**](https://github.com/rkdud007/xxfunc): Serverless functions on Reth using exex. [Post](https://x.com/piapark_eth/status/1825051859985330598). I wanted to experiment with exex and believe the potential of serverless.
- [**cairovm-verifier**](https://github.com/iosis-tech/cairovm-verifier): Rust implementation of a CairoVM verifier with WebAssembly bindings. [Post](https://x.com/piapark_eth/status/1814387878660571496). It was part of exploration into zk in an client-side context.
- [**alloy-merkle-tree**](https://github.com/rkdud007/alloy-merkle-tree): Merkle Tree implementation in Rust. Built because there was no standard mpt implementation in Rust, and I wanted to use this primitive in [alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs).
- [**zetina**](https://github.com/iosis-tech/zetina): Shared P2P zk prover network. Explored the idea of a minimal prover network on top of lib-p2p.
- [**sp1-storage-proof**](https://github.com/rkdud007/sp1-storage-proof): Storage proof with SP1. [Post](https://x.com/jtguibas/status/1758227197654114791). Built to experiment with the speed of building a zk-storage proof program on top of a RISC-V based zkVM.

**_Work_**

- [**Herodotus Data Processor**](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp): Herodotus Data Processor Toolkit. Enhances zk-offchain compute for verifiable on-chain data using zkVMs. [Docs](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/developers/data-processor).
- [**Trie proof**](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/trie-proofs): A comprehensive transaction MPT proofs handler for Ethereum / Starknet.
- [**L2 indexer**](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/L2-indexer): Indexer for Ethereum Layer 2s (OP Stack rollups, Arbitrum, etc.).
- [**Rust accumulators**](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/rust-accumulators): Accumulator library that contains MMR and Merkle Tree implementations.

**_Miscellaneous_**

- [**mini-storage-proofs**](https://github.com/rkdud007/mini-storage-proofs): Simple workflow for exploring storage proof concepts in EVM/Starknet/offchain. I also have a write-up about this [here](https://www.piapark.me/mini-storage-proofs).
- [**chess-dojo**](https://github.com/rkdud007/chess-dojo): Provable chess game built on the Dojo engine and Cairo language.
- [**ascii-video**](https://github.com/rkdud007/ascii-video): A CLI tool that plays videos in the terminal as ASCII art.
- [**rifle**](https://github.com/rkdud007/rifle): Starknet block time estimator in Rust.
- [**toji**](https://github.com/rkdud007/toji): CLI toolkit for EVM blockchains, retrieving RLP-encoded block headers and hashes.
