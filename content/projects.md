I enjoy building in public. It helps me to learn from scratch and also
helps other people who might face similar challenges in understanding
complex concepts. Here are some projects but sometimes I'm bit lazy to update list,
[check my github](https://github.com/rkdud007) for more alpha :P.

_Personal_

- [alloy-merkle-tree](https://github.com/rkdud007/alloy-merkle-tree) : Merkle Trees implementation in Rust
- [sp1-storage-proof](https://github.com/rkdud007/sp1-storage-proof) : Storage proof with SP1
- [toji](https://github.com/rkdud007/toji) : CLI toolkit for EVM blockchains, retrieving rlp encoded block headers and hashes
