I enjoy building in public—because sharing ideas and code is playing a positive-sum game ≽^-⩊-^≼

- When I encounter new technology or an interesting concept, I often think about its potential applications, consider how it could be combined with other ideas, and I build experimental projects around it and share them publicly.
- I like to create and contribute to open-source projects, CLI tools, or libraries that I find useful and share them so others can benefit.

Here are some of my projects. Sometimes I'm a bit lazy about updating this list. For more, [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007) for the latest!

⭐️ **Highlighted Projects**

- **xxfunc**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/xxfunc), [Post](https://x.com/piapark_eth/status/1825051859985330598) | Serverless functions on Reth using exex. I wanted to experiment with exex and believe in the potential of serverless.
- **cairovm-verifier**: [GitHub](https://github.com/iosis-tech/cairovm-verifier), [Post](https://x.com/piapark_eth/status/1814387878660571496) | Rust implementation of a CairoVM verifier with WebAssembly bindings. It was part of exploration into zk in a client-side context.
- **alloy-merkle-tree**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/alloy-merkle-tree) | Merkle Tree implementation in Rust. Built because there was no standard MPT implementation in Rust, and I wanted to use this primitive in [alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs).
- **zetina**: [GitHub](https://github.com/iosis-tech/zetina) | Shared P2P zk prover network. Explored the idea of a minimal prover network on top of lib-p2p.
- **sp1-storage-proof**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/sp1-storage-proof), [Post](https://x.com/jtguibas/status/1758227197654114791) | Built to experiment with the speed of building a zk-storage proof program on top of a RISC-V based zkVM.

**_Work_**

- **Herodotus Data Processor**: [GitHub](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/hdp), [Docs](https://docs.herodotus.dev/herodotus-docs/developers/data-processor) | Herodotus Data Processor Toolkit. Enhances zk-offchain compute for verifiable on-chain data using zkVMs.
- **Trie proof**: [GitHub](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/trie-proofs) | A comprehensive transaction MPT proofs handler for Ethereum / Starknet.
- **L2 indexer**: [GitHub](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/L2-indexer) | Indexer for Ethereum Layer 2s (OP Stack rollups, Arbitrum, etc.).
- **Rust accumulators**: [GitHub](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/rust-accumulators) | Accumulator library that contains MMR and Merkle Tree implementations.

**_Miscellaneous_**

- **mini-storage-proofs**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/mini-storage-proofs), [Write-up](https://www.piapark.me/mini-storage-proofs) | Simple workflow for exploring storage proof concepts in EVM/Starknet/offchain.
- **chess-dojo**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/chess-dojo) | Provable chess game built on the Dojo engine and Cairo language.
- **ascii-video**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/ascii-video) | A CLI tool that plays videos in the terminal as ASCII art.
- **rifle**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/rifle) | Starknet block time estimator in Rust.
- **toji**: [GitHub](https://github.com/rkdud007/toji) | CLI toolkit for EVM blockchains, retrieving RLP-encoded block headers and hashes.
