> _I'm currently in a phase of exploring hard problems by expanding curiosity and reflect on ['great work'](https://www.piapark.me/manifesto/). I'm open to discussions — feel free to reach out on X/email if you'd like to chat_


I enjoy building [projects](https://www.piapark.me/projects/) in public and participating in [activities](https://www.piapark.me/misc/) to learn and contribute to the community \
I’m also currently studying computer science at [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do)

For around past two years, been working at [herodotus.dev](https://herodotus.dev) solving the challenge of fragmented data in blockchain scaling through cryptography included rust engineering/product

When I'm not coding, I like to read, [write](https://www.piapark.me/blog/), and take a walk. I also love traveling and exploring different cultures.

I'm pretty curious about people and their own unique stories - i like to chat about life, philosophy, and technology.
