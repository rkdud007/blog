_I love learning engineering and mathematics_ \
_I love solving hard problems and building things in public_ \
_I love understanding architecture and architect systems_

At the moment, I enjoy building with Rust ðŸ¦€ Iâ€™m interested in systems programming, distributed systems, cryptography, and zero-knowledge proofs

- i've been questioning about where verifiable computation is really required or beneficial. Trying to think around real-world applications that combine zero-knowledge proofs or other cryptographic concepts (e.g., MPC, FHE).
- curious about different VM design choices and their components (e.g., compiler, execution, state design..), particularly in the context of zkVMs or blockchain VMs.

Currently working at [@herodotus.dev](https://github.com/HerodotusDev) as a software engineer. \
Also computer science major at [@korea university](https://korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do).

When I'm not coding, I like to read books, write thoughts, and take a walk. I also love traveling and exploring different cultures.
I'm pretty curious about people and their own unique stories - i like to chat about life, philosophy, and technology.
