It's fascinating to think about how our "language" is so limited in representing everything in the world. Compared to the original target's complexity, which could be felt in five senses, description from language is too narrow and limited to deliver in a 1:1 manner. So what happens is the target is transformed into a lower-dimensional reflection where language lives. What's more fascinating here is that this transformation actually recreates a totally different target, not just as a dimension downgrade. Moreover, this recreated meaning derives creativity, emotions, beliefs, and a story. 

Plato said, At the touch of love, everyone becomes a poet. Love is one of the most complex objects that we are barely able to represent. "I love you" doesn't really show how much I love you. Kissing you doesn't really fully tell how much I love you. However, because of the limitation, we try be more creative. We try to bypass. So everyone transforms love into a poem. Which is a dimension downgrade, but rather recreates its own beauty.  

Therefore, I’ve decided to call this limitation of the complexity, as art. I want to live doing art: continuously exploring and gently peeling back the vast complexity that surrounds a single human life. In the end, that search may have to conclude like a blind person touching an elephant’s leg, finishing without ever grasping the whole. But that’s okay. Because my own act of recreation will still make me richer.
