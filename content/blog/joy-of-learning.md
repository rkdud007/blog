### resume

I started my programming at 20. I started to use smartphone for the first time in my life and was amazed at how it influenced me and locked me up so quickly, I was amazed at how information is delivered so quickly and how big is the impact unit.

In my small world, I just had one goal and future to go *to a good university* like every other kid in Korea.

By observing the power of technology, I got obsessed with the idea that 'with this technology, I can make an impact on the bigger world. Not in my house, not in my school, not in my country the *world* itself though certain timespan of history'.

Then I got obsessed with learning how to make software, and how to share this software with a broader group and learned business, and I've kept searching for ways to make a higher impact, by keep trying the best I can do in each step.

At some point, felt like I got super-power. I could easily make the idea that I have into a real, software format, and I could share, and make an impact with a bigger group, of people in my country. The view of software becomes way more detailed.

Then I realized there is a wall between me and the world, which is language. I couldn't get access to information in English, and couldn't share my idea or story in English. Been consuming information that is proxied by other people who translate English into Korean.

So I got obsessed with expanding my world by naturally using this tool language. Jumped into flight for the first time, forcing myself to set all environment to English -- read/write/think/speak/listen, almost radically saying trying to forget I can speak Korean.

When I got to share my ideas more naturally when I got to make close relations with people, when I got to access pretty much all kinds of major information on the internet -- and pretty much every single time I realize it even now -- I feel so much freedom and joy of having this super-power, and I'd like to call as *"The joyful from expansion of self from curiosity mix with the craving of freedom"*.

### pause

The moment that I realized, everything can be enjoyable just how much you are curious about, the world felt like magic. With computer science, I could imagine my CPU is processing each input syscall through the keyboard while typing this blog by each clock cycle by cycle. With physics, I could imagine how every single material is composed of a tiny little combination of particles.. from quark. With biology, I could imagine when I feel stressed how norepinephrine particles had been delivered and caused this...

During my existance, I could view my world and self in various directions with so much fundamental knowleges behind -- what a lucky situation! -- so meaning learning is endless. It just doesn't end.

When I meet a person from a totally different background, I'm learning that his *world*. How he views, what are his assumptions and perceptions toward things, and what are his natural reactions and preferences.  This explains many cultural realizations that have broadened my view of life.

In lots of cases observations and experiences are stacking, with these files of data, we could figure out a pattern that we name as realization. It can be true, but maybe will be denied by a later case. But in any way, we are stating some realizations -- which are as knowledge. We are stacking whole human beings' knowledge throughout history and categorizing the dozens of knowledge that we are learning.

I believe learning should be enjoyable. We are learning not to become successful, or famous.. we are learning to understand each other. Each other including from people to the whole universe. Just like the enjoyment of getting to know each other, enjoyment of understanding the world, understanding the technology, and understanding the phenomenon. The more we get to learn, the better we can understand what's happening behind the scenes. Which gives joy and also gives wisdom for making a better decision.

So yes, I love learning.
I love to observe myself expanding.
My understanding of the world is becoming detailed over time to time.
Sometimes, to understand something that I am not familiar with I might need some practice overtime to get familiar with supported tools. But it's ok, my motivation is heading toward behind the wall.

I'm proud to have expanded my world, my small world with My family, my school, my neighborhood.. to a broader world, humanity, human knowledge, and various countries.

I'm no longer learning by forced -- external input that stimulates inner cravings like gaining fame, earning power, getting money -- I'm learning because I'm curious. I'm curious about computers, and how this tiny machine could make this huge sophisticated modern world by delivering information across the world. I'm curious about physics, how our world got formed, and how my existence should be viewed. I'm curious about biology and philosophy why I keep craving to learn life, and where this motivation and emotions are coming from. Even tho sometimes this external stimulation blurs me, I just keep holding my belief that learning should be an honest and genuine journey.

And I know to understand properly, it takes time. It takes lots of effort to solve the puzzle, dozens of dozens of times of practice to get familiar with the language -- language in terms of high-level interface that represents abstraction. And the more fundamental truth we are craving it takes more time and it's more challenging. But, it's powerful. like the beauty of math. Every phenomenon is explained in one single abstraction.

So yes, I'll keep learning while not losing curiosity for the world. I'll open and expand my world wider.
Consciously listen to where my passion is heading, and enjoy the hard work toward freedom.
