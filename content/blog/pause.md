*Wall*, represents limitation, or the boundary of comfort/skilled zone. Interesting part is, walls are everywhere, but you'll got to encounter certain walls because you somehow got interested it.

*Block by the wall*, reach the point where cannot go over unless put strong and consistent effort to break it. Usually first wall is mentally feeling insecure and scared of risk, and further blockers test out consistency (depends on how radical change you take).

*Expanding*, hardworking toward the new point outside of the wall. Sometimes, depends on your talent and environment expansion can happen fast/slow, but with consistent hardworking will eventually get the some point if you enjoys it

If the speed is fast, it's difficult to change the direction. I believe it's important to check the direction occasionally so to adjust by keeping similar speed and slowly change the direction. Otherwise conflict between direction of current and goal will anyway loosen the speed -- which we sometime call as burnt out.

Past few days, i paused. Reason is, i cannot be in "healthy obsession" with it anymore (found right vocabulary after read blog). Why that's issue? my whole life is constructed with cycle of ring the bell ->  obsession -> intermediate pause. This also sometimes refer as dot from famous quote "connecting the dots".

[1 - 2017~2019] When i first encountered quantum physics, it ringed the bell because the knowledge was endless and plus still theres non-discovered knowledge -- and i got obsessed on discovering it. Read pretty lots of relevant materials books/articles/documentary/paper and emailed relevant lab's professors/book authors about questions. I was also interested in broader modern physics & engineering where pushing on non-discovered knowledge, which lead on deep study around physics subject in general. My motivation was to research on quantum transportation so to discover non-exist technology to humanity or work in place like CERN.

[pause - 2020] Biggest issue was, i had no idea where to start proper research on other than scrapping all public information out there. And as i got university and surrounded with different environment, naturally paused obsesion. Lesson learn from first obsession is 'I need to connect with people if want to be obsess more further and longer'.

[2 - 2020~2022] When i first encountered concept of founding software product company, it ringed the bell because I had no idea how app/website that i've using everyday was built -- and i got obsessed on building and make people to use it. Started to learn from html/css/js alone, scrapping info and guide from online and praticing it. Things turned bit easier than first iteration, i joined/build several programming/product local community, and got to connected with software/start-up people well in korea. Went to bunch of startup programs, joined and grouped side projects as well, I didn't cared of technical detail as long as it just work, so I focused on ship it fast, frontend and product. My motivation was to build product that many people uses it all over the world -- like instgram or facebook.

[slight pause - 2022] Obsession moved slightly different direction as realized build impactful product with already stabilized technology is really difficult. Especially was feeling limited as all the start up ideas are like be more localize, be more niche which at certain i couldn't buy with this direction anymore. Lesson learn was, i want bigger stage.

[2.1 - 2022~2023] When i first encountered blockchain, it ringed the bell because technology is really interesting that nft, dao which discrupting legacy society in some way but still  early stage -- and i got obsessed to create new idea or product that doesn't exist but can change the world. I first started in korea as could easily get connected/get a job, and build/join a block chain communities. Still did frontend coding, and did some trial to build start up out of some products or joining the team. Motivation and focus was same as previous obsession, just targeted for different domain to achieve.

[slight pause - 2023] Obsession moved slightly different direction as realized all the scope i had been obsessed with was just inside one country, korea -- which couldn't make buge impact as global scale as i wanted. Tho changing the focus on the early stage domain helped to scale impact broader, there was still a limit. Still same lesson learn Lesson learn was, i want big stage where can impact global and history.

[2.2 - 2023] My motivation was same, but targeted more broadly. Starting with attending global hackathon seemed nice start. During 2023.01 ~ 2023.07 i just hopped on one country(= hackathon) to another, and shared what i built and connected via twitter. I focused on expand my viewpoint and tried to surrounded with smart people who are up to date with industry.

[pause - 2023] Actually while i tried to be surrounded with smart people in the industry, I felt limited that couldn't understand the deep underlying technology. Also many of the ideas are not web/app based, means there was lots of case that cannot be made only with frontend coding skill that i had. Lesson learn from second obsession is 'i want to understand blackbox that i obsessed with properly'

[3 - 2023~2024] So start from here motivation changed. Instead of focusing building product, I'd more like to be good at rust and understand technology behind. I went back to university to learn computer science from beginning, Started to learn rust while tried to do opensource contribution/ build opensource projects that's related to blockchain. And got to move position in company to kind of rust engineer. I enjoyed as i got to expand limitation surrounded me. I got to understand new technical concept more quickly, I got to build/implement out of any of idea, concept pretty easily, every idea looks much more tangible for me -- feels i got super power to craft whatever i want.


[pause - 2024] I still have similar motivation now, i cannot stand the blackbox.
- Because of my new motivation to just curious to understand technology as itself: my interest and curiosity become quite broaden from cryptography to systems programming( distributed system/DB/OS/Compiler). And now i quite viewing blockchain as one of the technology that have special property of decentralization.
  - so my first confusion is : among all topics which one i can focus first -- probably what's related to work
  - so my second confusion is : yes the work that im currently doing doesn't give much of challenge to learn topics i mentioned
