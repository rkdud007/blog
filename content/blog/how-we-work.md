I tried to understand why and how people decide to work on some problem and commit to a potential solution.

So first, different people are at different stages, which I framed into three:
- A. Finding new belief, imagining a new future that doesn’t exist, or identifying a new problem.
- B. From the given belief, finding a new solution that captures a share of the belief.
- C. From the given solution, crafting and scaling while solving challenges.

To be more detailed, each stage means:
- A. Thinking a lot about whether this problem is worth solving. On a macro scale, this means searching for new markets or new types of value capture that don’t yet exist and that not many people believe in.
- B. Having an assumption about a belief, whether from yourself or someone else, and diving deep into this belief to figure out what’s missing to achieve it. If this results in a new or sufficiently compatible solution, you might build your own.
- C. Having an assumption about both the belief and the solution from yourself or someone else. Then diving deep into crafting a masterpiece. This requires actual building, skill development, and long-term commitment.

e.g 1)
belief: AGI will be achieved
problem: current state of AI has a gap
solutions: multiple models from different companies

e.g 2)
belief: traditional finance should be complemented/altered with crypto
problem: TPS is too slow, scaling problems, liquidity issues, etc.
solutions: multiple blockchains, tokens

The relationship between each stage is simply coupled with assumption. If you don’t believe in a problem, then a solution is meaningless. So if you don’t believe in the future, then the problem itself is meaningless. For example, someone who doesn’t believe that traditional finance will be altered by crypto won’t find crypto appealing. Therefore, Ethereum scaling discussions or the ETH vs. SOL vs. BTC market share fight will seem meaningless to them.

One important note is assumption. Every belief has flaws—whether from a lack of information or misinformation. What you believe in, the problem you see, and the solution you try to build all have flaws.

Once you notice these flaws, you start to doubt all three stages: Is this future actually right? Is this problem the right thing to solve? Is this solution correct?—all because you don’t want to allocate yourself to something that isn’t right. This somewhat even looks like [the paradox of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice)

But people choose to work on something. People keep building and believing in something.

My hypothesis is:
- Most people don’t doubt things at a macro scale because this requires thinking outside the box. So they simply choose to believe → choose a problem → even choose a solution from others.
- Few people who think outside the box and decide to work on something do so in one of three ways:
  - 1.	They compensate for flaws in their belief/problem/solution with something reasonably appealing enough despite their doubts.
  - 2.	They are simply obsessed with the idea, even when considering the whole picture.
  - 3.	They just get lucky.

Regarding productivity, to actually build something long-term, you need to commit to a particular solution. And peak performance in commitment often requires not doubting the box itself.

For example, if you keep doubting whether Rust is the best language to learn and never spend time actually learning it, you won’t make any progress. And within consistent commitment, you can achieve crafting a masterpiece, whether at an individual scale or bigger.

So then, is doubting the problem and solution harmful? I don’t think so. If you look carefully, many companies fight in zero-sum or dead-end games. A macro view can help navigate whether to avoid choosing the wrong problem or solution in the first place.

Ok, so the conclusion is that we just need a balance between correcting direction (= thinking outside the box) and, once we’ve chosen the box, pushing forward with commitment without doubting it. I’m pretty curious about how people who have built great work navigate this balance—especially those who tend to think/doubt the box but can’t just naturally accept it, yet still commit for a long time.
