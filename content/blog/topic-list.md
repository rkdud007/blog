Here are some topics that i'd like to dive more to learn.

- grpc vs rpc vs REST
- rust `String`, `&str`, `str`, `Cow`
- b-tree, b+tree, lsm tree and how they are used in databases
- how does rust analyser works: seems there some limit of error parsing depth maybe does utilize some kind of tree like AST?
- learn some basics like C, assembly. this video really seems fun : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU8MnZI0snA&t=1069s
