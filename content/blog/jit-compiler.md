### why i'm curioused

so i have a big strong goal to build my own zk vm (which atm i have looots of missing building blocks). I was reading [Cairo VM paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063.pdf) but sudden at section 2.2.3, Advanced optimizations (just in time compilation and bytecode generation), i just COULDN"T understand the intuition of WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY you insert the machine code! So i decided to dive more deep into it.
