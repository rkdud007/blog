At the start of this year, I rotated around the Earth in a full circle for a month (Jan 7th ~ Feb 8th): Asia > Europe > America > Asia

Since deciding to move on from my job last November, I had been thinking a lot about my next step. I wanted to find a clearer motivation that genuinely come from myself and conviction on why all of this even matters with a bigger picture to double down on something. So, to zoom out, I decided to place myself in random locations on earth by simply following people , [people I respect for various reasons and also consider good friends](https://www.piapark.me/to-you/) who I’d like to hang out with no matter where they are (rotating earth in full circle is kinda cool and escaping from cold winter of korea as bonus).

I was a bit worried since it was my first experimental fully solo trip without any work-related planning, like attending a conference or doing in-person work. Instead, this time, I just tried to be open to new things, new people, and random occasions.

So it was an amazing experience. I freely flew across the earth. With just one carry on luggage, I decided my next location, flight, and housing only a week before. It felt like living in the unknown all the time, constantly being forced out of my comfort zone. But over time, my threshold for handling risk got higher, and I simply got used to this unstable state with minimal anxiety. I've got to hang out with totally different friend groups each week with different backgrounds, belief systems, and motivations. By overcoming various challenges from this unplanned travel, I gained the confidence that I could survive in any random place on earth, make friends, and become part of a community from scratch - basically there’s nothing you can lose cus you can start from scratch anytime.

Obviously, this confidence came from good people, who shared small kindnesses: they invited me to dinner, events, hangouts, they accepted my random reach outs, or even invited me to stay (when I was homeless lol). I feel really grateful to the people I met on this journey — those who were open to friendship, shared experiences and inspirations, and deep conversations about life. It was surprising to realize how many people are genuinely open to connection if I am also being genuine. And this made me   feel fulfilled.

Toward the end of my trip, I started to realize that maybe the reason I’m fascinated by cryptography, systems engineering, crypto (combination of economy and tech), or any other intellectually stimulating and unique things isn’t just solely because they are interesting in themselves. Actually, that alone isn’t enough to form my conviction. It’s more about the ability to interact and share ideas and build something with smart, interesting, and curious people — people whose knowledge and understanding of a field form gated niche communities, creating a special intellectual bond that, in many cases, leads to unique friendships which I am looking for.

So, what started as a random journey has, in some way, helped me discover myself and some genuine motivation. And most importantly, every friendship and bond I had with people on the way remains as a part of me
