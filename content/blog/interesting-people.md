I’ve always wanted to be surrounded by “interesting people.”

Growing up in Korea and then working in tech, for me what “interesting” means: smart, building a company or a cool project, international background, basically the people I admire on internet and mostly on tech.

Traveling made me realize I might’ve been biased.

Now I think what really makes people interesting is whether they’re genuinely happy with their life, and more about the reason of what makes them happy.

- I met a guy from Chile who’s been a rafting guide for 10 years. I met him in Queenstown, New Zealand, he goes back and forth between NZ and Chile, guiding seasons and teaching at a university on the side.
- I met another guy in Yukon, Canada who loves his dogs so much he’s run a husky sledding business for 20 years. He lives with his two daughters and his dogs, and he’s deeply proud of the life he chose.

It’s not about how much money they raised or what company they work for. They chose a life with high agency, stayed long enough to get deep, and their happiness comes from mastery + place + people, not external validation.

Technology is introducing huge shifts in the world. But that doesn’t mean people who don’t jump on every shift are living the wrong life. What matters is finding what you truly care about and finding people who truly care about you. That care becomes fuel for mastery, and the journey stays pleasant step by step.

I still want to be surrounded by interesting people. Which means I’m also trying to become one. Realizing this definition is more about the process than the outcome has made me listen more closely to what I really care about. I also know it’s not something you "figure out" in a single day with hard work, it’s more about living fully, following curiosity, and looking back at the traces you’ve stacked over time.
