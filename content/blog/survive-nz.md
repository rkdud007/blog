### background

Early this year, I had an idea of “I want to put myself in the nature and fully disconnected with people and work, and find what I really wanna do with my life”. From late January to mid February, I spent 3 weeks in New Zealand. The cottage house was located in the middle of tiny towns called “Clyde” and “Alexandra” both population was around 1~2k. Other than that it was just the house with the garden and the roads surrounded by beautiful mountains and lake. 

### phase 1. Escape 

Initial few days was magical. The scenery was perfectly what I was dreamed of, I intentionally disconnected my self to internet and instead read bunch of books(I’ve brought 4 books; The meditation, What man lives for, Art of love, The big wave) that I brought and write random stuffs on my mind. I was focused on the present. Meaning just looking at the trees, and lakes, lookup the sky etc. As the house was very nature friendly house, meaning there was little bit of insect problem but I was getting used to it the more I’m staying. In fact I’ve learnt it’s the default cost of staying place with beautiful garden. 


### phase 2. Recursive Frustation 

Yes, except for few of activities such as cherry picking, finding food or coffee places, cooking, and rafting and travel around the city, just me and nature doesn’t get myself to know better about my self by talking to oneself. At some point I was just looking at the bees moving in random directions but also aware the fact that it’s only random because I don’t have enough knowledge of bee’s world , I felt like “wow anything that I’m doing with my life is pretty much this random entropy that bee is generating”. It’s like realizing every ambition, or second order desires about money, fame, achievements etc that probably influenced by society felt no meaning in different dimensions, therefore it’s not absolutely meaningful as what society believes. This phase been lasting for few days. It’s so ironic to see myself surrounded by beautiful things that I’ve thought been craved for, but feel much frustration than before. Like now I finally obtained the environment and time and energy to use it purely for myself, but why I was feeling much meaningless over the world, frustration.

### phase 3. Distraction 

One frustration hit the bottom, while crying in the middle of the most beautiful scenery, decided to change the direction. Decided to give myself distraction. I opened the internet, read random things what’s happening and what people are excited about, played with the tech like making my own projects and just read thought these. I’ve actually spent quite a bit time learning about agents and ai in general. It’s little bit uncomfortable because now that I decided to full distracted myself by seeing what other peoples are interested in on twitter, I was confused does my curiosity came from genuine myself or am I just cloud chasing. Like I didn’t wanted to come to this remote environment just to cloud chase. 

Another type of distraction was I messaged more friends and people that I wanted to talk to. I’ve talked about my frustration I’m experiencing, talked about the distraction that I’m adjusting, and just listening to what they up to and focus on it to distract myself. Also I’ve started to watch some K-drama. The natural uncomfortable feeling arises within the approach because I was questioning myself am I just taking blue pill for the sake of escape. 


### phase 4. Understanding 

At the end, I can say mainly I’ve learnt: genuine excitement cannot be distinguished with propagated excitement, in fact it’s same, so I need my people to stay excited together. 

I always had questions for myself: What do I want to devote my life to? Probably it reveals in [manifesto](https://www.piapark.me/manifesto/), I really want myself to be devote on something really great. Great enough that it can positively influence many people and potentially make the world a better place. And I’ve been thinking that if I really find something that I genuinely love, I’ll gonna stick to it for decades and be great at it but also happy. The fact that I'm spending my life on something I'm so excited about, such as pushing the boundaries of human limits, contributing to one of the most important problems in the world, and being responsible for so many people who depend on my craft, all the things that woke me up in the morning are pleasant. 

Now next question, where does excitement come from? Initially, I believed in destiny. Every intermediate steps are just a means to an end, and by going through different phases of life/people, I'll eventually find what I really want to live for. Another counterclaim for this is that excitement propagates. It's not something rooted in oneself; it propagates through a community surrounded by people/community who are excited about something. And generally this brings up interest and marinates within one's internal value and potentially leads to excitement as well. 

How it propagates? People. People who I surrounded with, that I’m interacting with base on common interest on some topic. By making slow progress and share it and exchange the ideas makes one of the core drive for stay excited. So I want to surround myself with people who are excited, therefore [interesting people](https://www.piapark.me/interesting-people/).

###  The end

Anyway I’m writing this on the flight way back from NZ. I remember middle of the days, I was crying and about to give up this remote time and just back home early. Looking back, the beautiful scenery are the only one remains the mind and even missing the time there. 

Again it repeats but, everything has a limit. Good times and bad times all have limits, even the life itself. At the end, enjoy life and do things that don’t regret and love the people.
