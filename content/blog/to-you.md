Hi! Thank you for decide to read this
> In some shape or form, perhaps weâ€™ve interacted in each otherâ€™s lives, so I want to thank you for being part of my journey. This letter is my way of wrapping up 2024 and sending letter to you â€” hope you enjoy it ðŸ’Œ


At the [end of 2023](https://www.piapark.me/year-of-unknown-unknown/), my focus was *just grind all day*. I was full of passion for going down the rabbit hole of cryptography and engineering. From January to almost this summer, my daily routine and hobby literally just work and learning. I participated in some great opportunities to learn cryptography (at the start of this year, I had no confidence in it). At work, I pushed forward with responsibility. In spare time, learned further technical fundamentals and pushed side projects out of curiosity. Generally, I donâ€™t regret my Q1 and Q2 hard work, because I was so determined to understand and be capable of doing great work (in engineering atm) and it was soo fun!

But by the end, I was bit burnt out.

In Q3 and Q4, I began to think a lot more (as you can see by the increasing number of life tagged blog posts). A lot of changes, events happened. Frankly, I suffered. So just like the metaphor of running I used in [this post](https://www.piapark.me/born-to-run/), I slowed down and thought about my direction.

I believe that, because of this suffering, Iâ€™ve learned most valuable lessons of my life, and they make me excited about the start of this new year. For me, 2025 will be about *grateful and love*. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m also writing this as a letter.


Iâ€™m happy we got to interact in whenever, whatever shape.

Sometimes I was intellectually stimulated by you, other times I was inspired by your story. Sometimes I learned from you; how you think, how you act, how you react to others. Sometimes I purely enjoyed moments with you. Sometimes your presence gave me fulfillment and relief, even when events in my life felt devastating. Sometimes I was able to dream big because of your support. Sometimes I realized a totally different perspective from you. Sometimes I admired your work, sometimes I admired your wisdom.

You â€” of different ages, genders, nationalities, interests, personalities, abilities, experiences, and relationships with me â€” I love you

I first learned how to love myself at the end of this year: listening to inner voice carefully and taking care of how Iâ€™m feeling and doing. I was able to stand alone in life with fulfillment (which life had always been alone). And the more I fill myself with love, the more I wanna spread it. I spread it to my family, who have always been my number one supporters throughout my entire existence, and to my good old friends whoâ€™ve stayed by my side no matter how Iâ€™ve changed. Also good new friends and everyone who has gotten to know me in various ways. Love with support, love with care

I picked up hobbies recently that actually been interested 10+ years ago: Iâ€™ve started playing chess quite consistently again. Iâ€™ve also been developing my personal taste again in art, music, philosophy, and literature etc. One of my goal for this year is to solidly develop of self - become true adult haha

During 2024, I traveled to Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Brussels, New York, San Francisco, Greece, and Turkey from quite of a great opportunities. Each of these trips taught me lessons, gave me unforgettable memories and friendships, and helped me grow. Iâ€™ll continue to travel in balance. Iâ€™ve realized I love traveling to reconnect with friends.


So again, thank you for being part of my journey - maybe itâ€™s a tiny chunk of time that seems like nothing in the [macro view](https://youtu.be/4Tm6Z1y3h94?si=TI5YEikhqZ4RIK11) â€” but itâ€™s okay. I enjoyed every single moment with you.

Excited to meeting, interacting, hanging out, getting to know, reconnecting, and building something together with you in 2025.

Happy New Year!

Love,

From Me
