Today I'll gonna talk about small observation or philosophy -- for fun lol.

I drew a coordinate plane about the x-axis, how much you are good at things, and with the y-axis, how much you are aware of your current self. And this coordinate is assuming who has a desire for success / high achievement / high skillset.

The most obvious ones are case 1,4. If you already have high skill and achievement, first it's pretty not difficult to realize that fact wherever the environment is, second the case of having low self-awareness is I think either by wrong/limited environment or personality(less confident/low satisfaction bar etc). But anyway to become the right-hand side of the x-axis, to "actually" become good at things takes time and consistent hard work so either 1,4 is a pretty straightforward situation.

So things get tricky in case 2,3. Because **everyone starts from the left side of the x-axis**. Obviously, no one got the best at something in the first place. So, everyone - young people who just started their career - who wants to achieve these will try to find a way to accelerate their growth. And base on my observation, it tends to be on the boundary of *Fake it till you make it vs LARPing*.

> "Fake it till you make it" (or "Fake it until you make it") is an aphorism that suggests that by imitating confidence, competence, and an optimistic mindset, a person can realize those qualities in their real life and achieve the results they seek.

> LARPers are people who create a fake persona with a social media account that is usually anonymous. In other words, pretending to be someone they are not.

I draw a line between these two even though they look maybe similar. The differential point is **self-awareness**.

During the early days of my career, most of my growth came from the high tension of fake-it-till-i-make-it. I interpret this sprite of mind as getting more courage to accept failure and increase the tension of challenge -- but at the same time if that subordinate effort becomes the main one then the effort on "actually trying to be good" with less self-awareness on where exactly the point that I'm in, it just becoming LARPing. You can leverage the social media persona but if the gap between your ideal self and your imagination becomes smaller, the tension to accelerate decreases and it just doesn't work out.

So my short-boring-occasional-reminder take is I'll keep trying on actually trying to be good -- at the same time keeping re-assessment of re-evaluation of self-aware.
