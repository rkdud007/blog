*============================================*

*Be patient, don't overthink*

*Every "great" thing takes time*

*So dream optimistically, execute consistently*

*And whatever, love the moment*

*============================================*

I maintain a list of messages to become a better human
### smile
-  Smile :) no one can curse in front of a smiling face
-  Important: get some humor :P make some jokes, make me and others laugh, you don't have to be serious all day
-  Feel tired? Close your eyes, take a deep breath.. count 1 2 3.. and try to enjoy the moment. Come back to the present!
-  Always be grateful! Grateful that you have a life to enjoy, meet interesting people, share ideas and stories, share respect and learn. So happy that I'm myself.
### respect
-  Everyone has something to teach! Be curious about their world, make conversation to learn.
-  Just let go. If there is a crowd, of course some people will hate me, some will love me, some will have no opinion
-  Don't underrate people. You were dumb before and still are. And everyone is too. So please have the attitude of a learner. Don't underrate moments. You cannot make it here if there's no help from others
-  Also don't overrate people. You can respect, but do not be obsessed.
### consistency
-  Don't think too much, and if you didn't hear explicitly, don't overthink based on your feeling. Just do your own thing. Just do what you can do
-  Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you'll get... so keep going
-  It's classic -- practice really makes perfect. Don't expect everything to be perfect from the start.
### honest
-  Be honest. You don't need to act like you are smart, don't need to be cool or cold. Just be yourself, the self that you show to your close people that you trust! Just have an honest attitude always
### misc
-  Don't make promises that you cannot be sure to keep. It's ok to say No.
-  Make sentences clear. Do actions clearly. Express gratitude / apologies clearly. â€” be professional
-  Sometimes if really feeling tired, just reject everything and take some time. Sometimes it's better than doing things by force
